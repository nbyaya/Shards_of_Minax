100% plug and play. This system keeps track of simple achievements which are account based.

Your players can open the achievement gump by utilzing the command [MyAchievements
Your players can open other players achievements by utilizing the comment [Achievements
Staff can wipe all achievement data to start over by utilizing command [ResetAchievements

If you do not want players seeing other players achievements, in AchievementSystem.cs, approximately line 77, you would set "ViewOthersAchievements" to false. It is true by default

In the event you want to add a context menu entry to PlayerMobile.cs, approximately line 2292, you replace this:

				if (DisabledPvpWarning)
				{
					list.Add(new CallbackEntry(1113797, EnablePvpWarning));
				}

with

				if (DisabledPvpWarning)
				{
					list.Add(new CallbackEntry(1113797, EnablePvpWarning));
				}


				list.Add(new Server.Achievements.AchivementGumpEntry(this));

then, approximately line 2335, replace:


				if (curhouse != null)
				{
					if (Alive && curhouse.IsAosRules && curhouse.IsFriend(from))
					{
						list.Add(new EjectPlayerEntry(from, this));
					}
				}

with

				if (curhouse != null)
				{
					if (Alive && curhouse.IsAosRules && curhouse.IsFriend(from))
					{
						list.Add(new EjectPlayerEntry(from, this));
					}
				}

                		if (from is PlayerMobile)
                		{
                    			list.Add(new Server.Achievements.AchivementGumpEntry((PlayerMobile)from, this));
                		}

Awarding Items:

To Award Sovereigns (for UO Store):
1. AchievementSystem.cs,  approximately line 81, change AwardSovereigns to 'true'
***note*** line 82 awards, by default, 5x the achievement points as sovereigns

To award custom items:
1. As explained above, change AwardSovereigns to true.
2. in Achievement.cs approximately line 206, comment out this code:

			pm.AccountSovereigns += award;
			pm.SendMessage("You have earned {0} account sovereigns!", award);

3. and replace it with the appropriate code to add your custom item. For example:

			int award = (int)((double)Points * AchievementSystem.SovereignMultiplier);

			if (award > 0)
			{
				//pm.AccountSovereigns += award;
				//pm.SendMessage("You have earned {0} account sovereigns!", award);

				var item = new ChainLegs();
				pm.AddToBackpack(item);
				pm.SendMessage("You have been awarded chainmail leggins for completing this achievement!")
			}
